# Elm LSP
Language server for Elm with diagnostic support, built on [elm-analyse](https://github.com/stil4m/elm-analyse).

## Deprecated as of 2019-06-01

I recommend using [elm-language-server](https://github.com/elm-tooling/elm-language-server) instead, it includes everything in this repo along with additional features like finding all references, jumping to definitions, and more.

Shown with ALE integration in Vim.
